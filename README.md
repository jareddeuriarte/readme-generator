# README Generator

  ## Description
  Among the tasks asked of a developer, somehow out of all the text we write a simple README is the biggest bother––hunting down a markdown cheatsheet, copying and pasting from an old README, riffling through windows and screens to copy urls and relative paths, flipping back and forth between the document and 'Open Preview'. This application automates the brunt of creating a README through the simple expedient of command line interfacing.
